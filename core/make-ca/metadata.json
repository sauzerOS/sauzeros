  "info": "make-ca is a utility to deliver and manage a complete PKI configuration for\nworkstations and servers using only standard Unix utilities, OpenSSL, and\np11-kit, using a Mozilla cacerts.txt or like file as the trust source. It can\noptionally generate keystores for OpenJDK PKCS#12 and NSS if installed. It was\noriginally developed for use with Linux From Scratch to minimize dependencies\nfor early system build, but has been written to be generic enough for any Linux\ndistribution.\n",
